# Fuzzy Control for Furuta Pendulum

This project implements a fuzzy control system for the Furuta Pendulum, aiming to achieve stable and efficient control over the pendulum's motion. Below are the steps to initialize and run the project using PlatformIO, an open-source ecosystem for IoT development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [PlatformIO Core](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (optional, but recommended for a better development experience with the PlatformIO IDE extension)

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the main source files for the project, including the main control algorithms.
- `lib/`: Intended for project-specific (private) libraries.
- `include/`: Directory for project header files.
- `test/`: Contains unit tests for the project.
- `.pio/`: Contains PlatformIO build output and other system-generated files (ignored by git).
- `platformio.ini`: PlatformIO project configuration file.

## Initialization

To initialize the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine using git:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
